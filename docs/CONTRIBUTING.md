## Creating tests

## Reporting bugs

When finding one it's best to report an issue providing these information :

* what you want to do (the objective in english)
* what you tried (the code)
* what happened
* what you expected to happen

## Good practices

Some things to think about when submitting a Pull Request or making a commit :

### IDE

All JetBrains IDE are the best for coding in any languages.

* [Goland](https://www.jetbrains.com/go) for Go code
* [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider) for C# code
* [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) for everything else (markdown, makefile ...), see [workspace config](../.vscode/settings.json)
